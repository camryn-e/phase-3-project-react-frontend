# Pride Events Project

## Description
This React app allows users to add LGBT pride events worldwide to a Rack database. Users can add a city to the database, click on that city, and fill out a controlled form on that city's page to add a LGBT pride event to the database. The pride event's title is displayed on the city's page, and when clicked, displays the other information the user entered along with the catagory, the description, and the age rating. This app also allows users to cancel events and delete them from the database.
